What is a databse?

A database is a way to store data, where the data can be accessed and modified.

Relational databases don't just store data. They make it possible, and offer tools,
 to query, summarize, compare and connect data. In addition to this, they often
  have built in rules to make sure that data is not disturbed, destroyed or treated
in a way that corrupts it.

To understand how relational databases work, it is important to understand that they
are built on the data of which they consist. In other words, you must undertstand what
your data has in common to be bale to build or understand the database structure.
