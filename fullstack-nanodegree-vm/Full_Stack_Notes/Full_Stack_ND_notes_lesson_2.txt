Queries

First, here is an example:

QUERY = '''
select name, birthdate from animals where species = 'gorilla';
'''

The above querirs for name and birthdate in the table animals, but only for the
 animals that have the species gorilla.


Some datatypes in SQL:

text - a string of any length, like Python's str type.
Values are written in 'single quotes'.

integer - like Python's int type, but with different limits.

date - a calendar date.
values are written like this: '2016-02-10'.
The single quotes are important, as the interpreter will think that the above(without
single quotes) means 2016 - 2 - 10, which gives an output of 2004.


Querying for something which excludes certain types can be done by writing:
select name from animals where (not species = 'gorilla').
This can also be done  with python-like annotation:
select name from animals where species != 'gorilla'


The one thing SQL is kind of terrible at

For some reason, it is difficult or impossible to check out the names of tables or of
 columns in tables through your code. You have to do it through your console. And different
 terms are used for different types of SQL.

Insert Statements are easier than Query statements.
Basically: insert into table(names of columns separated by commas) values(names or values of data inside single quotes, separated by commas);


Joins

Example: select T.thing, S.stuff from T, S where T.target = S.match

Here is an example from the quiz:
QUERY = '''
select animals.name from animals join diet on animals.species = diet.species where food = 'fish';
'''

Alternatively:

select name from animals, diet where animal.species = diet.species and diet.food = 'fish';


And here is the answer for the triple join example:

select ordernames.name, count(*) as num
  from animals, taxonomy, ordernames
  where animals.species = taxonomy.name
    and taxonomy.t_order = ordernames.t_order
  group by ordernames.name
  order by num desc


Note to self: Remember the 'group by' as this was your donwfall in solving this first time.
